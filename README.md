This project runs a simple localhost server that reads from and writes data to a json file.

It is designed to function with ApacheTestClient project.
Currently, unit tests are written only for the JsonFileHandler class and shellscript file is missing.

When using Intellij the IDE should automatically build the Maven project and you should be able to run it.
